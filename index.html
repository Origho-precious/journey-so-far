                    <p>I quickly stopped learning HTML and CSS to learn Javascript (something i quickly regretted) I wasnn't really understanding Javascript so i bought another course on Udemy for javscript alone (Modern Javascript from the beginning by Brad Traversy & Javascript Complete Guide by Maximilian Schweurmuller) <br> PS: I didn't Complete both</p>

                    <p> After The Christmas in which I didn't code much, I got a UI developer job, So I had to learn and get better writing CSS i purchased a course on udemy (Modern HTML,CSS and(SASS) from the Beginning by Brad Traversy) This time I was determined to learn to code very well from the beginning no matter hw long it takes and to build projects with new concept learnt. <br> I actually learn alot and built lots of projects </p>

                    <p>Went back to one of the Udemy course I purchased earlier: he one by Brad Traversy. This time i learnt Javascript very well and built about 8 projects while learning. When I completed the course, I took some crash courses to learn NPM (& Yarn), Babel and Webpack</p>

                    <p>After earning vanilla Javascript and building projects with it, And also reading blogpots and articles of Javascript concepts, I felt ready to learn a Javascript framework/Library. <br>I chose Reactjs for some reasons and fromthen till date, I have been learning the library and other related libraries (e.g Redux) and building projects along the way.</p>
